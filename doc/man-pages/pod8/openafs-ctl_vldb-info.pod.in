The B<openafs-ctl vldb-info> command displays information about the Volume

=head1 OUTPUT

With a B<-format> of C<text>, database information is output as one piece of
information per line, in the form:

   field: value

With a B<-format> of C<json>, database information is output as a JSON-encoded
object.

At a minimum, the following fields are shown:

=over 4

=item B<type>

The type of the underlying ubik database. Currently, this is always C<flat>, to
indicate a database consisting of a single flat file.

=item B<engine>

The ubik storage engine implementing the database. Currently, this is always
C<udisk>.

=item B<version>

The current version of the database on disk, represented by an epoch (specified
in 100ns units of time) and a counter. For example the version C<1234.5> has an
epoch of C<1234> and a counter of C<5>.

=item B<size>

The approximate size of the database. The actual size of the database file on
disk may be different, due to ubik metadata and other data not considered part
of the database itself.
