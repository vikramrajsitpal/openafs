=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<openafs-ctl vldb-dump> commands dumps a copy of the Volume Location
Database (VLDB) from a locally-running B<vlserver>. The
B<openafs-ctl ptdb-dump> command is the same, but for the Protection Database
(PTDB) and the B<ptserver>.

While the data is being dumped, the database is "frozen" in ubik. For details
on what that means, see L<openafs-ctl_vldb-freeze-run(8)>.

If B<openafs-ctl vldb-dump> is run inside B<openafs-ctl vldb-freeze-run>, we
will not create a new freeze, but will use the existing freeze.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-output> <I<path>>

The path that B<openafs-ctl> should dump the VLDB to.

=item B<-require-sync>

If this flag is given, and the local B<vlserver> is not the sync site,
B<openafs-ctl> will exit with an error.
