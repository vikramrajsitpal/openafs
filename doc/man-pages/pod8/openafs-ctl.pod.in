=head1 NAME

openafs-ctl - Introduction to the openafs-ctl command suite

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<openafs-ctl> command suite allows for administrative control and
inspection of OpenAFS daemons. Unlike other command suites such as B<bos> or
B<vos>, the B<openafs-ctl> command suite does not communicate over the network,
and only communicates with daemons running on the same host through a unix
domain socket.

The protocol that the B<openafs-ctl> tool uses to communicate with OpenAFS
daemons may change over time and may not preserve backwards compatibility. It
is expected that administrators use the B<openafs-ctl> tool from the same
release of OpenAFS as the running daemons.

=head1 OPTIONS

The following arguments and flags are available on many commands in the
B<openafs-ctl> suite.

=head1 PRIVILEGE REQUIRED

Callers do not need any AFS tokens or Kerberos tickets to run B<openafs-ctl>
commands, but callers must be able to access the unix socket of the relevant
daemon. By default, these sockets exist in F</usr/afs/local>, and so the caller
will need to be the local superuser C<root> in order to run any commands.
