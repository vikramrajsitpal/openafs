=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<openafs-ctl vldb-freeze-run> command freezes the Volume Location Database
(VLDB) on a locally-running B<vlserver>, and runs the given command for the
duration of the freeze. The B<openafs-ctl ptdb-dump> command is the same, but
for the Protection Database (PTDB) and the B<ptserver>.

While the VLDB is frozen, the B<vlserver> can still read from the database to
service requests, but it cannot write to the database, and it cannot
synchronize the db with other dbservers. So while the database is frozen, the
specified command can read the VLDB directly from disk with the guarantee that
the VLDB is not changing underneath it. That is, as long as the parent
B<openafs-ctl vldb-freeze-run> command exits successfully, it is guaranteed
that the B<vlserver> never modified the VLDB while I<cmd> was running.
(However, I<cmd> may install a new database if the B<-rw> option is given.)

Specifically, B<openafs-ctl vldb-freeze-run> performs the following steps:

=over 4

=item *

B<openafs-ctl> freezes the VLDB

=item *

B<openafs-ctl> runs the given I<cmd> in a child process.

=item *

When I<cmd> exits successfully, B<openafs-ctl> ends the freeze.

=item *

If the freeze was successful (that is, it was not aborted), B<openafs-ctl>
exits successfully.

=back

If the freeze was aborted for any reason, B<openafs-ctl> exits with an
error (after waiting for I<cmd> to exit, if it was started). A freeze may be
aborted for a few reasons, including:

=over 4

=item *

If B<openafs-ctl vldb-freeze-abort> was run for the freeze.

=item *

If the I<timeout> for the freeze was exceeded.

=item *

If the I<cmd> exited non-successfully.

=back

If the freeze was aborted, and a new database was installed during the freeze,
it is assumed that something went wrong during the freeze, so the database is
reverted back to how it was when the freeze started (and the newly installed
database is removed). However, there is an exception to this:

If we installed a new database, and the new database was distributed to at
least one other dbserver, then we do not revert the database, even if the
freeze was aborted. This is done to avoid distributing the database multiple
times. For more information about distributing the database during a freeze,
see L<openafs-ctl_vldb-freeze-dist(8)>.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-cmd> <I<cmd>+>

The command and arguments to run while the database is frozen. The given
command is not run through the shell; separate arguments are given as separate
items to the B<-cmd> option. B<openafs-ctl> ends the freeze when the command
exits.

The given command is run with several environment variables set; see
L</ENVIRONMENT>.

The given command can read the database data directly, but it B<must not>
modify or write to the database. See L</CAUTIONS>.

=item B<-rw>

If this flag is given, the I<cmd> may install a new database during the freeze,
using a command like B<openafs-ctl vldb-restore>. By default, a freeze is
considered "read only", and so a new database may not be installed in such a
way.

Regardless of whether B<-rw> is given, the I<cmd> B<must NOT> directly write to
the database file (see L</CAUTIONS>). With B<-rw>, the I<cmd> can only install
a new database all at once using commands like B<openafs-ctl vldb-restore>. If
I<cmd> needs to modify the existing database, it must make a copy of the
database, then modify the copy, and install the modified copy.

This flag implies B<-require-sync>.

=item B<-require-sync>

If this flag is given, and the local B<vlserver> is not the sync site,
B<openafs-ctl> will exit with an error, and the database will not be frozen.

=back

=head1 ENVIRONMENT

The given I<cmd> is run with several environment variables added to the
environment. These are used by various B<openafs-ctl> commands to operate
within an existing freeze, but they can also be used by shell scripts or other
commands directly.

=over 4

=item OPENAFS_VL_FREEZE_ID
=item OPENAFS_PT_FREEZE_ID

The freeze id for the current freeze.

=item OPENAFS_VL_FREEZE_DB_PATH
=item OPENAFS_PT_FREEZE_DB_PATH

The path to the frozen database on disk.

=item OPENAFS_VL_FREEZE_VERSION
=item OPENAFS_PT_FREEZE_VERSION

The version of the frozen database. This can be used by the underlying command
to check that it is interacting with the correct database file.

=item OPENAFS_VL_FREEZE_CTL_SOCKET
=item OPENAFS_PT_FREEZE_CTL_SOCKET

The path to the socket used to communicate with the B<vlserver> or B<ptserver>.
You should not normally need to use this directly, but B<openfas-ctl> commands
will use it.

=back

=head1 EXAMPLES

This will make a copy of the VLDB, similar to B<openafs-ctl vldb-dump>, but
without various integrity checks:

    % openafs-ctl vldb-freeze-run -cmd -- \
        sh -c 'cp -v "$OPENAFS_VL_FREEZE_DB_PATH" /tmp/vldb.copy.DB0'
    Freezing database... done (freezeid 3, db 15895059090000000.1).
    '/opt/openafs/var/openafs/db/vldb.DB0' -> '/tmp/vldb.copy.DB0'

    openafs-ctl: Command exited with status 0
    Ending freeze... done.

This will run vldb_check against the VLDB without making a copy, and output
some freeze-related info:

    % cat runcheck.sh
    #!/bin/sh

    echo "Freeze id: $OPENAFS_VL_FREEZE_ID"
    echo "VLDB version: $OPENAFS_VL_FREEZE_VERSION"
    echo "VLDB path: $OPENAFS_VL_FREEZE_DB_PATH"

    # Do _NOT_ run with -fix!
    exec vldb_check "$OPENAFS_VL_FREEZE_DB_PATH" -uheader

    % openafs-ctl vldb-freeze-run ./runcheck.sh
    Freezing database... done (freezeid 8, db 15895059090000000.1).
    Freeze id: 8
    VLDB version: 15895059090000000.1
    VLDB path: /usr/afs/db/vldb.DB0
    Ubik Header
       Magic           = 0x354545
       Size            = 64
       Version.epoch   = 1589505909
       Version.counter = 1
    Header's maximum volume id is 542870957 and largest id found in VLDB is 542870954
    Scanning 2000949 entries for possible repairs

    openafs-ctl: Command exited with status 0
    Ending freeze... done.

This will restore a new VLDB, and check that the B<vlserver> seems to be
handling the new VLDB correctly. We only distribute the new VLDB if the
B<vlserver> responds with valid data. If anything goes wrong, the script will
exit with an error, and the database will be reverted back to the original
version.

    % cat do_restore.sh
    #!/bin/sh

    set -xe

    # The new vldb.DB0 to restore
    NEW_VLDB=

    # A config dir with only the local dbserver in it, forcing vos to run
    # against the local vlserver
    LOCAL_CONFIG=

    # A file containing the expected output of 'vos listvldb vol.important',
    # below.
    VOS_OUTPUT=

    # tmp workspace
    tmp=/tmp/restore
    mkdir $tmp

    # Only install the new vldb locally
    openafs-ctl vldb-restore "$NEW_VLDB" -dist skip -backup-suffix .bak

    # Check that the new vldb looks ok
    vos listvldb vol.important -noresolv -config "$LOCAL_CONFIG" > $tmp/vos.out
    diff -u $tmp/vos.out "$VOS_OUTPUT"

    # vldb looks ok, so distribute the new db to other sites
    openafs-ctl vldb-freeze-dist


    % openafs-ctl vldb-freeze-run -rw -cmd ./do_restore.sh
    Freezing database... done (freezeid 1, 16213700780000000.2).
    [...]

    Ending freeze... done.

    Existing database backed up to suffix .bak
    + vos listvldb vol.important -noresolv -config LOCAL_CONFIG
    + diff -u /tmp/restore/vos.out VOS_OUTPUT
    + openafs-ctl vldb-freeze-dist
    Distributing restored database (may take a while)... done.

    openafs-ctl: Command exited with status 0
    Ending freeze... done.

=head1 CAUTIONS

The given I<cmd> B<must NOT> write to or modify the database on disk in any
way (even if the B<-rw> option is given). Doing so can cause corruption in the
database, and inconsistent behavior between dbservers.

=head1 PRIVILEGE REQUIRED

Callers must be able to open the unix domain socket for the relevant daemon
process. By default, this is a socket in F</usr/afs/local>, and the caller must
be the local superuser C<root>.
