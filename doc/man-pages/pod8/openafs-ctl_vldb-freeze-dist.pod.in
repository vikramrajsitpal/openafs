=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<openafs-ctl vldb-freeze-dist> command distributes a newly-installed
Volume Location Database (VLDB) from a locally-running B<vlserver>. Normally
this is done automatically by a command such as B<openafs-ctl vldb-restore>,
but triggering the distribution step with a separate command can give finer
control over the freeze process (see examples in
L<openafs-ctl_vldb-freeze-run(8)>).

The B<openafs-ctl vldb-freeze-dist> command must be run inside a freeze via
B<openafs-ctl vldb-freeze-run>, and the freeze must have already installed a
new database via B<openafs-ctl vldb-restore> or a similar command.

The B<openafs-ctl ptdb-freeze-dist> command is the same, but for the Protection
Database (PTDB) and the B<ptserver>.

The B<openafs-ctl vldb-freeze-dist> command must be run on a dbserver that is
currently the sync site. See the B<openafs-ctl vldb-freeze-run> option
B<-require-sync>.

For more information about freezes, see L<openafs-ctl_vldb-freeze-run(8)>.
